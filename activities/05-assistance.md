<h2>Achieving Clarity in Complex Assistance Discussions</h2>

A primary impetus for the assistance role of Facilitators is that
researchers often benefit significantly by having a translator of
complex concepts and terminology when learning to effectively utilize
ACI resources. To this end, Facilitators must strive to find language
that is already familiar to researchers, *especially* for assistance
communication. As discussed more thoroughly in 
*[Educating and Training Researchers](../06-education)*, 
education research indicates that non-experts are more
effective in teaching concepts that are novel to learners, as teachers
with greater expertise already possess a more sophisticated
understanding and set of terminology (see [^4] and 
[^5] for more discussion on this topic).

Other specific guidelines for clear wording in any communication context are:

<div class="bullet-box">
  <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li markdown="1">Avoid overwhelming the researcher with too much new information at once.
Please see *[Educating and Training Researchers](../06-education)* in the Use of ACI, [^4],
[^7], and [^8] for more discussion on concept/cognitive overload.
</li>
  </ul>
